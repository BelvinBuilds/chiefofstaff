## **AI Chief of Staff for an Early-Stage VC Investor (MVP)**

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** [Investor Name]
**Date:** October 2025

---

## **1. Product Overview**

The **AI Chief of Staff (AI-CoS)** is a virtual operations and intelligence assistant designed for a single investor within a small early-stage VC fund.
It integrates with the investor‚Äôs daily workflow across **Microsoft tools, Salesforce, Monday.com, Zoom, Slack, and research platforms**, providing real-time assistance with deal management, meeting synthesis, scheduling, and insights.

The MVP aims to deliver a **single Slack-based interface** where the investor can:

* Ask for context on any company, meeting, or founder
* Automatically process inbound deals
* Receive daily briefings and summaries
* Approve or reject AI-drafted messages and CRM updates

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

Early-stage investors face overwhelming operational complexity:

* 100+ inbound startup pitches per month via multiple channels (email, Typeform, FormAssembly).
* Continuous meetings with founders, LPs, and partners requiring manual note capture.
* Disconnected data across Salesforce, Monday.com, Zoom, and Outlook.
* Time lost to repetitive coordination, follow-ups, and task management.

The investor lacks a unified, intelligent system that **keeps context across tools**, **summarizes information**, and **executes low-level tasks autonomously but safely**.

---

## **3. Objectives**

1. **Centralize information flow** from Outlook, Salesforce, and Monday.com into one AI workspace (Slack).
2. **Automate repetitive workflows** ‚Äî data entry, meeting notes, and task creation.
3. **Provide proactive briefings and insights** to keep the investor contextually aware.
4. **Ensure compliance and privacy** via secure data handling and human approval checkpoints.

---

## **4. Target User**

**Primary User:**

* Individual VC investor (GP or Principal) managing deal sourcing and portfolio relations.

**Future Secondary Users:**

* Other partners or analysts at the fund who may need shared insights or summaries.
